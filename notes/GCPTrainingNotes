Google Cloud Platform:
=======================
Cloud computing is nothing but the delivery of on-demand resources over the internet on pay as you use pricing method.These on-demoand resources are provided by a cloud provider and one such cloud provider is GCP.

Definition:
===========
GCP is a set of cloud computing services by Google which run on the same infra as that of other services like youtube,gmail etc.
Domains: 
--------
1.Compute - App engine ,compute engine ,kubernetes engine ,cloud functions, cloud run 
2.Storage -Cloud Storage,cloudSql,Bigtable,cloudDatastore 
3.Networking -VPC,cloud DNS,cloud Armor,cloud CDN
4.BigData -BigQuery,cloud Datproc,coloud data prep.cloud pub/dub etc.
5.Developer tools-clod sdk,deployment manger,cloud source,cloud test labs
6.Identity and security-IAM,security key,KMS etc.
7.IOT -cloud IOT,edge TPU
8.API platform-maps platform etc.

Project:
========
Any resource you create in GCP will be created inside a project .Any resource can only be cretaed whenever you are working under a specific project.

Services:
=========

IAM :
====
1.create a service account with minimal permissons and add users into that account
```
master@w3:$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json --iam-account cloudexpert@gcptutuorials.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
The key file is the from:
=========================
The format of the key may differ depending on how it is generated. Keys created using the Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool look like this:
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "gcptutuorials",
  "private_key_id": "key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nprivate-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "service-account-email",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-account-email"
}
```
master@w3:$ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=gcp.json
Activated service account credentials for: [cloudexpert@gcptutuorials.iam.gserviceaccount.com]
```

Compute Engines:

ssh into a compute instance:
============================	
1st way : using a gcloud cli command

```
gcloud beta compute ssh --zone "asia-southeast1-b" "instance-1" --project "gcptutuorials"
ak0107@w3:~/gcp_test$ gcloud beta compute ssh --zone "asia-southeast1-b" "instance-1" --project "gcptutuorials"
Updating project ssh metadata...â ¹Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/gcptutuorials].
Updating project ssh metadata...done.
Waiting for SSH key to propagate.
Warning: Permanently added 'compute.7976604803214466465' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Welcome to Ubntu.
```
2nd way :using ssh browser from the UI 

3rd way : using ssh keys
